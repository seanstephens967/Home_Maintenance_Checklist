Service Manager 1.0 is a program that helps companies manage all their service projects through one centralized location.

[Getting Started]

First you’ll need to create an account by selecting Register in the Nav bar or the "Get Started" button in the body. Once your account is set up you will want to begin creating technicians under the Technicians tab and properties under the Property tab. This is important because a project can’t be created until there is at least one technician and one property to assign it to (due to safeguards put in).

[Special Considerations]

Another important thing to note is how the projection completion date works. Most projects will be created without a creation date. Without the completion date the project will show up under Open Projects. The completion date can be added upon creation or modified though the Edit link when viewing projects. Once a date of completion has been added that project will now show up under Completed Projects.

In future versions of the program there will be a SOP (Standard Operating Procedures) class that will hold instructional guides to specific projects. When you enter in instructions when creating or editing a project the data will return to the table as a hyperlink which is currently linked to a blank instructions page. In the future, SOP guides will be available as a drop down feature when creating or editing a project.

The last thing to note is the Users section. As of now this table view only unless given admin rights. In future versions of the project, certain data will only be created and edited by an Administrator.
